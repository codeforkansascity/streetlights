# Lights, Cameras, Action!
Streetlights are at the front lines of the smart city. 
They offer a public place to hang cameras, sensors, wireless antennas and more. 
They also provide new revenue streams by renting out space to hang things or lowering energy costs through LED conversions. 
But how do policy makers decide how to use this newly valuable asset, and how do residents weigh in on the process? 
We want to make information about how are streetlights are used more transparent and accessible.
